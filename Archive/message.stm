<tt>Hi Andrey, there is the answers to your questions:</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>A> Are they published in Internet?</tt>
<p><tt>No nothing done for the moment. The only things I usually do is
small utility for my own usage (because normally I don't do helps file
with my programs, and this is normally badly seen by users, this is why
I don't publish them). I just decided to translate this class because I'm
planning to use it and the least I can do is to help you for the translation
as well as you help me with this class (because I need an utility that
couldn't been possible without your class. And I'm sure the translation
will help a lot of french people who are not good with english).</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>A>What version had You translated?</tt>
<br><tt>A>In TRegExpr 0.941/2 was very many changes in help.</tt>
<p><tt>The most recent one which is v. 0.942</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>A>The only purpose for this may be publishing on-line version of</tt>
<br><tt>A>French help (my help generation tool can produce .html as well
as</tt>
<br><tt>A>.hlp, .chm and .rtf-documentation). But I think I can easely
extract</tt>
<br><tt>A>sources from Your .hlp, so the only question - do You want it
will be</tt>
<br><tt>A>published as on-line hlml-help on my home page as well as .hlp
in</tt>
<br><tt>A>TRegExpr distribution package.</tt>
<p><tt>Yes you can publish it on both if you want, as long as the class
remain FREEWARE.</tt>
<p><tt>I'm including the source files just in case, you're not able to
extract the original one.</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>A>I thought about making it multilingual (I wrote very simple class
that</tt>
<br><tt>A>I am using in my projects to create multilinguale interface -
it uses</tt>
<br><tt>A>RTTI and can swith languages "at the fly").</tt>
<p><tt>This sounds like a good news.</tt>
<p><tt>About the demo maybe you can take a look on the translated I'm sending
you to figure out how to do the french one (for the french text). I must
warn you that I resized a couple of objects (some text wasn't fitting inside
them). And don't worry about a couple of things who look the same in french
as well as in english, this is because some words can't be translate (because
a lot of specific computer language is in english, and french people know
the meaning of these words anyway).</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><tt>A>I decided to add national character sets to TRegExpr and now I
am</tt>
<br><tt>A>collecting national resources.</tt>
<br><tt>A></tt>
<br><tt>A>I need French characters arranged in French alphabet order and</tt>
<br><tt>A>separated in small and big (capital) character sets.</tt>
<br><tt>A>Also I need name of character table for this chars.</tt>
<p><tt>I need to tell you that french canadian use the Latin 1 language
table.</tt>
<p><tt>But before I must explain you a little french fact. We use the same
language set than english, except that we also use the characters with
accent (they are there in the latin set), but not all of them. Example:
for us the e, &eacute;, &egrave;, and &euml; is the same letter than "e"
except that the tree last ones have accent (they are just pronounced differently).
For example in a r.e. for finding an "e"&nbsp; in french it should be "[e&eacute;&egrave;&euml;]".
I putted characters with accent at the end but this is not the good order
(I've done this for readability).</tt>
<p><tt>LocaleName = "Latin-1"</tt>
<br><tt>Low Case&nbsp; = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&agrave;&acirc;&ccedil;&eacute;&egrave;&ecirc;&euml;&icirc;&ocirc;&ucirc;";</tt>
<br><tt>High Case = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&Agrave;&Acirc;&Ccedil;&Eacute;&Egrave;&Ecirc;&Euml;&Icirc;&Ocirc;&Ucirc;";</tt>
<p><tt>List of values just in case Your email program can't show characters
with accent.</tt>
