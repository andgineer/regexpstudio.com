Hi Andrey
<p>
Fine homepage ... nice look ... everything that's needed is there. 
<p>
And of course thank you for your honorable mention of me in your help file ... I was not aware that I did earn this .. :-)
<p>
Anyway, I was always lurking for some thing like TRegExpr in native Delphi code ... you gave it to us and this is what need some honorable metion.
<p>
You know we always have work for you .. if you ever want to quit your job ... we'd be happy to find you .. :-)
<p>
Best regards

Have downloaded your Regular Expression component. :)
It's a perfectly new thing for me :( , but how much easier
my work could be if I had had it earlier!
I'll try and learn it and write back to you.
Thank you very much for creating this!

Hello Andrey,

I'm glad to (Virtually) meet you on the net. It's like
a great trip for me to the far from America but nevertheless
dreamed of Russia ans St-Petersbourg.

I found your work very useful to me. I already teached Unix 
and the Grep like utilities and will undoubtedly find some 
utility for your Rgrepexe tools as I am learning Delphi to 
support my back end engine on my new NT Internet Web server,
which will be used for teaching support. so I will have to 
analyse open responses to many exams... and your tool will 
be welcome then.

For your TaudioInfo, I am currently getting for all the 
information I can before working on the details of a new 
Shopping Center Music Dispenser, sort of Remote controlled 
Digitally stored Music Jukebox. I needed more information
about ID3 tags format and Your contribution is also welcome
to me as a starter in this new field.

Keep up the good work, and thanks again, Gйrard

P.S. I'll keep you in touch when my products will be in 
operation. May be it could bo of interest to you, who knows?

(where is lithuania in list, eh? "=)")

hail,
  .. all that is fine, in addition to SGRegExp, YGrep, PerlRegEx i found one new LIB :) Just gonna try and compare it to PerlRegEx. 
  Mine problem is this: there are some variations of regExp :( And i still cannot "decode" all your exps on explaining page.
  BTW, short introduction to VERY begining of any kind of Regular Expressions would be accepted very much, esp. by beginners.. I have some basics-info, but .. i have not enough time/wish. Write me if you think even loosers in RegExp must easy learn something, :)

  OK, there was nice to meet such page.
till,

Hello Andrey, 
 Thanks for the nice component. I shall test it 
and get back . It will save hours of coding for searching 
things out from the strings . Great  thought . Good Luck

Das Vadonia!

Sorry, I can't spell in Russian but "Hello" from Atlanta, Georgia in the USA.

I am just learning Delphi 3 and am amazed with what you are able to do in a few lines of code!

You have a lot of skill and knowledge and I wish you well.

My father's parents were from Hungary and some day I'd like to visit where they came from to learn more about my heritage.

Sperseba / Thank You

Hi!

TRegExpr was a first toolkit I used to solve some string handling problems and I found it powerfull enough for that case. But recently I encountred with two missing features and as was turned out later they are in todo list.
So I just want to vote for those 2 features:
* working with Pascal strings
* non-greedy style
The second one I think most important and TRegExp will be really powerfull supporting that feature.

Generally TRegExpr is stable and very usefull. Thank you.

Да нужны. Особенно нужен TRegExprEdit.
Да и VCL-версия of TRegExpr - для чайников тоже нужна. Я например не очень
силен в составлений таких выражений.
Так что очень хотелось бы что бы ты в следующем релизе ты сделал
TRegExprEdit.

Easy to use and comes with good examples. This should be 
included with standard Delphi! :)
