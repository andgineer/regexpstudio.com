# A free SSI utility for LOGCNT.CGI users.
# THIS program displays only the total of a counted link.
# linkcount.cgi displays the hyperlink PLUS the count.

#  This file can only be obtained via the above web addresses,

# 
# TO USE - SSI ONLY: If you would like to place text displaying the number of
# times one of your counted hyperlinks has been clicked, place this 
# call in the html text of an SSI page (.shtml etc) ie:
#
# "File downloaded <!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/linkname.cgi"--> times."
#
# where 'linkname' is one of the names you entered in the "hitlink.t" file.
# For each link count you want to access, simply copy this file with the new 
# name and place it in your cgi-bin (chmod 755). 
# ie link1.cgi, Contact.cgi, Page_One.cgi, etc. (must be legal file name format)
# So, to display 5 different counted link values, you will have, and call, 
# 5 different scripts - simple. I use them on my 'Webmasters page' so I don't
# have to run the Admin page every time I log on to the Internet. A result of 
# only "-" means the names do not match, "!" = a script or file access error.
# The supplied "webmster.shtml" includes examples.
