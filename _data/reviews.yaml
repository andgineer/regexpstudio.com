    I am a teacher. The Danish teachers in Computer Science have just

    the subject Regular Expressions with examples from Perl, Delphi (using
    your unit) and JavaScript.
    I find your unit very versatile and easy to use. The fact that it is
    distributed as a unit and not a component to be installed in the
    Delphi-system makes it particularly attractive.

    I found your work very useful to me. I already teached Unix

    utility for your Rgrepexe tools as I am learning Delphi to
    support my back end engine on my new NT Internet Web server,
