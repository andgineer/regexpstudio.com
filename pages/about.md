I'm software developer from St-Petersburg, Russia

### Bio

In february 1994 I concluded my study in
[Saint Petersburg Electrotechnical University "LETI"](http://www.eltech.ru/en/university),
it was 6-years study but there were no Bachelor/Master degrees in Russia, just "high education".

Department of Electron Devices Design and Manufacturing, at the time it was pretty close to computer science.
