TRegExpr library implements regular expressions in pure Delphi.

<a href="https://github.com/masterandrey/TRegExpr" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" role="button">Github repo</a>

Now it's included into [Lazarus (Free Pascal)](http://wiki.freepascal.org/Regexpr).

TRegExpr is easy to use and powerfull tool for sophisticated search and substitutioning and for template-based text checking (especially usefull for user
input validation in DBMS and web projects).

You can validate e-mail adresses, extract phone numbers or ZIP-codes from web-pages or documents, search for complex patterns in log files and all You can imagine!
Rules (templates) can be changed without Your program recompilation!

As a language for rules used subset of Perl's [regular expressions](/regexp_syntax) (regexp).

Full source code included, pure Object Pascal.
Thus, You need no DLL!
The library source code is compatible with Delphi 2-7, Borland C++ Builder 3-6, Kylix, FreePascal
(if You see any incompatibility problems, please. drop the bug-report to [author](/about)).

Documentation in English, Russian, German, Bulgarian, French and Spanish available at TRegExpr
<a href="http://regexpstudio.com/tregexpr/TRegExpr.html" target="_blank">home page</a>

Installation is very simple, the implementation encapsulated completely into class
[TRegExpr](/tregexpr_interface/).

[Demos projects](https://github.com/masterandrey/TRegExpr/tree/master/examples) and
[usage articles](http://masterandrey.com/posts/en/text_processing_from_birds_eye_view.html) illustrate simplicity and power of text processing with the library.


If You need Unicode (so called 'WideString' in Delphi) - see
[How to use unicode](tregexpr_interface#unicode).

### Gratitudes
