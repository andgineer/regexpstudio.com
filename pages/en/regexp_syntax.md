## Important note

Below is the description of regular expressions implemented in freeware
library [TRegExpr](http://regexpstudio.com). 
The library was widely used in many free and commertial software products. 

## Introduction

Regular Expressions are a widely-used method of specifying patterns of
text to search for. Special metacharacters allow You to specify, for
instance, that a particular string You are looking for occurs at the
beginning or end of a line, or contains n recurrences of a certain
character.

Regular expressions look ugly for novices, but really they are very
simple (well, usually simple ;) ), handly and powerfull tool.

I recommend You to play with regular expressions using Windows 
[REStudio](https://github.com/masterandrey/TRegExpr/releases/download/0.952b/REStudio.exe) - 
it'll help You to uderstand main
conceptions. Moreover, there are many predefined examples with comments
included into repository of R.e. visual debugger.

Let's start our learning trip!

## Simple matches

Any single character matches itself, unless it is a metacharacter with a
special meaning described below.

A series of characters matches that series of characters in the target
string, so the pattern `bluh` would match `bluh` in the target string.
Quite simple, eh ?

You can cause characters that normally function as metacharacters or
escape sequences to be interpreted literally by 'escaping' them by
preceding them with a backslash `\`, for instance: metacharacter `^`
match beginning of string, but `\^` match character `^`, `\\` match
`\` and so on.

#### Examples:

     foobar         matchs string 'foobar'
     \^FooBarPtr     matchs '^FooBarPtr'

### Note for C++ Builder users

Please, read in FAQ answer on question [Why many r.e. work wrong in
Borland C++ Builder?](faq.html#cppbescchar)

## Escape sequences

Characters may be specified using a escape sequences syntax much like
that used in C and Perl: `\n` matches a newline, `\t` a tab, etc.
More generally, `\xnn`, where nn is a string of hexadecimal digits,
matches the character whose ASCII value is nn. If You need wide
(Unicode) character code, You can use `\x{nnnn}`, where `nnnn` - one or
more hexadecimal digits.

     \xnn     char with hex code nn
     \x{nnnn} char with hex code nnnn (one byte for plain text and two bytes for Unicode
     \t       tab (HT/TAB), same as \x09
     \n       newline (NL), same as \x0a
     \r       car.return (CR), same as \x0d
     \f       form feed (FF), same as \x0c
     \a       alarm (bell) (BEL), same as \x07
     \e       escape (ESC), same as \x1b

#### Examples:

     foo\x20bar   matchs 'foo bar' (note space in the middle)
     \tfoobar     matchs 'foobar' predefined by tab

## Character classes

You can specify a character class, by enclosing a list of characters in
`[]`, which will match any one character from the list.

If the first character after the `[` is `^`, the class matches any
character not in the list.

#### Examples:

     foob[aeiou]r   finds strings 'foobar', 'foober' etc. but not 'foobbr', 'foobcr' etc.
     foob[^aeiou]r find strings 'foobbr', 'foobcr' etc. but not 'foobar', 'foober' etc.

Within a list, the `-` character is used to specify a range, so that
a-z represents all characters between `a` and `z`, inclusive.

If You want `-` itself to be a member of a class, put it at the start
or end of the list, or escape it with a backslash. If You want `]` you
may place it at the start of list or escape it with a backslash.

#### Examples:

     [-az]     matchs 'a', 'z' and '-'
     [az-]     matchs 'a', 'z' and '-'
     [a\-z]     matchs 'a', 'z' and '-'
     [a-z]     matchs all twenty six small characters from 'a' to 'z'
     [\n-\x0D] matchs any of #10,#11,#12,#13.
     [\d-t]     matchs any digit, '-' or 't'.
     []-a]     matchs any char from ']'..'a'.

## Metacharacters

Metacharacters are special characters which are the essence of Regular
Expressions. There are different types of metacharacters, described
below.

### Metacharacters - line separators

     ^     start of line
     $     end of line
     \A     start of text
     \Z     end of text
     .     any character in line

#### Examples:

     ^foobar     matchs string 'foobar' only if it's at the beginning of line
     foobar$     matchs string 'foobar' only if it's at the end of line
     ^foobar$   matchs string 'foobar' only if it's the only string in line
     foob.r     matchs strings like 'foobar', 'foobbr', 'foob1r' and so on

The `^` metacharacter by default is only guaranteed to match at the
beginning of the input string/text, the `$` metacharacter only at the
end. Embedded line separators will not be matched by `^` or `$`.

You may, however, wish to treat a string as a multi-line buffer, such
that the `^` will match after any line separator within the string, and
`$` will match before any line separator. You can do this by switching
On the [modifier /m](regexp_syntax.html#modifier_m).

The `\A` and `\Z` are just like `^` and `$`, except that they won't
match multiple times when the [modifier
/m](regexp_syntax.html#modifier_m) is used, while `^` and `$` will
match at every internal line separator.

The `.` metacharacter by default matches any character, but if You
switch Off the [modifier /s](regexp_syntax.html#modifier_s), then `.`
won't match embedded line separators.

TRegExpr works with line separators as recommended at [www.unicode.org](
http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr18/):

`^` is at the beginning of a input string, and, if [modifier
/m](regexp_syntax.html#modifier_m) is On, also immediately following
any occurrence of `\x0D\x0A` or `\x0A` or `\x0D` (if You are using
[Unicode version](tregexpr_interface.html#unicode) of TRegExpr,
then also `\x2028` or  `\x2029` or `\x0B` or `\x0C` or `\x85`). Note that
there is no empty line within the sequence `\x0D\x0A`.

`$` is at the end of a input string, and, if [modifier
/m](regexp_syntax.html#modifier_m) is On, also immediately preceding
any occurrence of  `\x0D\x0A` or `\x0A` or `\x0D` (if You are using
[Unicode version](tregexpr_interface.html#unicode) of TRegExpr,
then also `\x2028` or  `\x2029` or `\x0B` or `\x0C` or `\x85`). Note that
there is no empty line within the sequence `\x0D\x0A`.

`.` matchs any character, but if You switch Off [modifier
/s](regexp_syntax.html#modifier_s) then `.` doesn't match `\x0D\x0A`
and `\x0A` and `\x0D` (if You are using [Unicode
version](tregexpr_interface.html#unicode) of TRegExpr, then
also `\x2028` and  `\x2029` and `\x0B` and `\x0C` and `\x85`).

Note that `^.*$` (an empty line pattern) doesnot match the empty string
within the sequence `\x0D\x0A`, but matchs the empty string within the
sequence `\x0A\x0D`.

Multiline processing can be easely tuned for Your own purpose with help
of TRegExpr properties
[LineSeparators](tregexpr_interface.html#lineseparators) and
[LinePairedSeparator](tregexpr_interface.html#linepairedseparator), You
can use only Unix style separators `\n` or only DOS/Windows style `\r\n`
or mix them together (as described above and used by default) or define
Your own line separators!

### Metacharacters - predefined classes

     \w     an alphanumeric character (including "_")
     \W     a nonalphanumeric
     \d     a numeric character
     \D     a non-numeric
     \s     any space (same as [ \t\n\r\f])
     \S     a non space

You may use `\w`, `\d` and `\s` within custom character classes.

#### Examples:
    
     foob\dr     matchs strings like 'foob1r', ''foob6r' and so on but not 'foobar', 'foobbr' and so on
     foob[\w\s]r matchs strings like 'foobar', 'foob r', 'foobbr' and so on but not 'foob1r', 'foob=r' and so on

TRegExpr uses properties
[SpaceChars](tregexpr_interface.html#tregexpr.spacechars) and
[WordChars](tregexpr_interface.html#tregexpr.wordchars) to define
character classes `\w`, `\W`, `\s`, `\S`, so You can easely redefine it.

### Metacharacters - word boundaries

     \b     Match a word boundary
     \B     Match a non-(word boundary)

A word boundary (`\b`) is a spot between two characters that has a `\w` on
one side of it and a `\W` on the other side of it (in either order),
counting the imaginary characters off the beginning and end of the
string as matching a `\W`.

### Metacharacters - iterators

Any item of a regular expression may be followed by another type of
metacharacters - iterators. Using this metacharacters You can specify
number of occurences of previous character, metacharacter or
subexpression.

     *     zero or more ("greedy"), similar to {0,}
     +   one or more ("greedy"), similar to {1,}
     ?   zero or one ("greedy"), similar to {0,1}
     {n}   exactly n times ("greedy")
     {n,}   at least n times ("greedy")
     {n,m} at least n but not more than m times ("greedy")
     *?     zero or more ("non-greedy"), similar to {0,}?
     +?     one or more ("non-greedy"), similar to {1,}?
     ??     zero or one ("non-greedy"), similar to {0,1}?
     {n}?   exactly n times ("non-greedy")
     {n,}? at least n times ("non-greedy")
     {n,m}? at least n but not more than m times ("non-greedy")

So, digits in curly brackets of the form `{n,m}`, specify the minimum
number of times to match the item n and the maximum `m`. The form `{n}` is
equivalent to `{n,n}` and matches exactly `n` times. The form `{n,}` matches `n`
or more times. There is no limit to the size of `n` or `m`, but large
numbers will chew up more memory and slow down r.e. execution.

If a curly bracket occurs in any other context, it is treated as a
regular character.

#### Examples:

     foob.*r     matchs strings like 'foobar',  'foobalkjdflkj9r' and 'foobr'
     foob.+r     matchs strings like 'foobar', 'foobalkjdflkj9r' but not 'foobr'
     foob.?r     matchs strings like 'foobar', 'foobbr' and 'foobr' but not 'foobalkj9r'
     fooba{2}r   matchs the string 'foobaar'
     fooba{2,}r matchs strings like 'foobaar', 'foobaaar', 'foobaaaar' etc.
     fooba{2,3}r matchs strings like 'foobaar', or 'foobaaar'  but not 'foobaaaar'

A little explanation about "greediness". "Greedy" takes as many as
possible, "non-greedy" takes as few as possible. For example, `b+` and
`b*` applied to string `abbbbc` return `bbbb`, `b+?` returns `b`,
`b*?` returns empty string, `b{2,3}?` returns `bb`, `b{2,3}` returns
`bbb`.

You can switch all iterators into "non-greedy" mode (see the [modifier
/g](regexp_syntax.html#modifier_g)).

### Metacharacters - alternatives

You can specify a series of alternatives for a pattern using `|` to
separate them, so that fee|fie|foe will match any of `fee`, `fie`, or
`foe` in the target string (as would `f(e|i|o)e`). The first alternative
includes everything from the last pattern delimiter (`(`, `[`, or the
beginning of the pattern) up to the first `|`, and the last alternative
contains everything from the last `|` to the next pattern delimiter.
For this reason, it's common practice to include alternatives in
parentheses, to minimize confusion about where they start and end.

Alternatives are tried from left to right, so the first alternative
found for which the entire expression matches, is the one that is
chosen. This means that alternatives are not necessarily greedy. For
example: when matching foo|foot against `barefoot`, only the `foo`
part will match, as that is the first alternative tried, and it
successfully matches the target string. (This might not seem important,
but it is important when you are capturing matched text using
parentheses.)

Also remember that `|` is interpreted as a literal within square
brackets, so if You write `[fee|fie|foe]` You're really only matching
`[feio|]`.

#### Examples:

  foo(bar|foo) matchs strings 'foobar' or 'foofoo'.

### Metacharacters - subexpressions

The bracketing construct `( ... )` may also be used for define r.e.
subexpressions (after parsing You can find subexpression positions,
lengths and actual values in MatchPos, MatchLen and
[Match](tregexpr_interface.html#tregexpr.match) properties of TRegExpr,
and substitute it in template strings by
[TRegExpr.Substitute](tregexpr_interface.html#tregexpr.substitute)).

Subexpressions are numbered based on the left to right order of their
opening parenthesis.

First subexpression has number `1` (whole r.e. match has number `0` -
You can substitute it in
[TRegExpr.Substitute](tregexpr_interface.html#tregexpr.substitute) as
`$0` or `$&`).

#### Examples:

     (foobar){8,10} matchs strings which contain 8, 9 or 10 instances of the 'foobar'
     foob(\[0-9\]|a+)r matchs 'foob0r', 'foob1r' , 'foobar', 'foobaar', 'foobaar' etc.

### Metacharacters - backreferences

Metacharacters `\1` through `\9` are interpreted as backreferences.
`\<n>` matches previously matched subexpression `#<n>`.

#### Examples:

     (.)\1+         matchs 'aaaa' and 'cc'.
     (.+)\1+       also match 'abab' and '123123'

  `(['"]?)(\d+)\1` matchs `"13"` (in double quotes), or `'4'` (in single
quotes) or `77` (without quotes) etc

## Modifiers

Modifiers are for changing behaviour of TRegExpr.

There are many ways to set up modifiers.

Any of these modifiers may be embedded within the regular expression
itself using the [(?...)](regexp_syntax.html#inline_modifiers)
construct.

Also, You can assign to appropriate TRegExpr properties
([ModifierX](tregexpr_interface.html#tregexpr.modifier_x) for example
to change /x, or ModifierStr to change all modifiers together). The
default values for new instances of TRegExpr object defined in [global
variables](#modifier_defs), for example global
variable RegExprModifierX defines value of new TRegExpr instance
ModifierX property.

 
<a name="modifier_i"></a>
### i

Do case-insensitive pattern matching (using installed in you system
locale settings), see also
[InvertCase](tregexpr_interface.html#invertcase).

<a name="modifier_m"></a>
### m

Treat string as multiple lines. That is, change `^` and `$` from
matching at only the very start or end of the string to the start or end
of any line anywhere within the string, see also [Line
separators](tregexpr_interface.html#line_separators).

<a name="modifier_s"></a>
### s

Treat string as single line. That is, change `.` to match any character
whatsoever, even a line separators (see also [Line
separators](tregexpr_interface.html#line_separators)), which it
normally would not match.

<a name="modifier_g"></a>
### g

Non standard modifier. Switching it Off You'll switch all following
operators into non-greedy mode (by default this modifier is On). So, if
modifier `/g` is Off then `+` works as `+?`, `\*` as `\*?` and so on

<a name="modifier_x"></a>
### x

Extend your pattern's legibility by permitting whitespace and comments
(see explanation below).

<a name="modifier_r"></a>
### r

Non-standard modifier. If is set then range а-я additional include
russian letter `ё`, `А-Я`  additional include `Ё`, and `а-Я` include all
russian symbols.

Sorry for foreign users, but it's set by default. If you want switch if
off by default - set false to global variable
[RegExprModifierR](#modifier_defs).

The [modifier /x](regexp_syntax.html#modifier_x) itself needs a little
more explanation. It tells the TRegExpr to ignore whitespace that is
neither backslashed nor within a character class. You can use this to
break up your regular expression into (slightly) more readable parts.
The `#` character is also treated as a metacharacter introducing a
comment, for example:

    (
    (abc) \# comment 1
      |   \# You can use spaces to format r.e. - TRegExpr ignores it
    (efg) \# comment 2
    )

This also means that if you want real whitespace or `#` characters in the
pattern (outside a character class, where they are unaffected by `/x`),
that you'll either have to escape them or encode them using octal or hex
escapes. Taken together, these features go a long way towards making
regular expressions text more readable.

## Perl extensions

### (?imsxr-imsxr)

You may use it into r.e. for modifying modifiers by the fly. If this
construction inlined into subexpression, then it effects only into this
subexpression

#### Examples:

     (?i)Saint-Petersburg       matchs 'Saint-petersburg' and 'Saint-Petersburg'
     (?i)Saint-(?-i)Petersburg matchs 'Saint-Petersburg' but not 'Saint-petersburg'
     (?i)(Saint-)?Petersburg   matchs 'Saint-petersburg' and 'saint-petersburg'
     ((?i)Saint-)?Petersburg   matchs 'saint-Petersburg', but not 'saint-petersburg'

### (?\#text)

A comment, the text is ignored. Note that TRegExpr closes the comment as
soon as it sees a `)`, so there is no way to put a literal `)` in the
comment.

Just now don't forget to read the [FAQ](faq.html) (expecially
