Hi, your is a valuable work.
TRegExpr is a great Class...

2003.07.04 David Lang, Austria
I've been using your Delphi regular expressions package, and find it 
extremely powerful.  I thank you for your efforts.

2003.06.26 Fernando Leandro Fernandes, Brasil
I'm very excited for
using regular expressions in my projects... it's a very powerful tool

2003.06.21 Arjuna Diaz, USA
I've been using your regexp package in my personal software for a while now,
whenever I need broad matching capabilities. Great job! Very easy to use.  Also,
I used to work at Bell Labs, so I'm a little familiar with stuff.

2003.05.12 Martin Barrowcliff, USA
I have your test-reg exp program. Very nice, you will soon be a top programmer in your country.
You are also ex military, as I am.

2003.03.02 Craig Manley, Netherlands
I'm a Perl and Delphi programmer and therefore find your class very useful.

2002.10.06 Tom Corcoran
I am using your Regular expression unit in Delphi, superb stuff, thank you.

2002.09.29 Jelmer Vos, Netherlands
It is very nice to see that you are still working with TRegExpr. I think it
is the best in the world for Delphi. Good work!

2002.08.13 Celso Rossi, Brasil
Im a dephi programmer and find the TRegExpr on the web. It is a Excelent
Interface and work Fine !.

2002.07.26 Ekki Plicht, Germany
big thanks for the TRegExp class... it's really fantastic and works very 
nicely. Good work!

2002.06.14 Riccardo Zorn, Italy
I am using your regexp component and put it on 3 different
projects. it's great, congratulations.

2002.05.07 Richard.
well done on the TRegExp package you created. It looks
very good !.

2002.05.30 Markus Dauberschmidt, Germany
I started using your TRegExpr unit some days ago to use regular expression
string replacements in my application.
Let me point out what a powerful class you've written! I'am really impressed
Siemens Business Services GmbH & Co. OHG

2002.04.29 Udo Weik, Germany
greetings from Germany! I'm just testing TRegExpr. Thanxs
for that wonderful component!

2002.04.12 Guru Ramnath Kathiresan
I been using your component for the past 10 months and i'm
very satisfied withit...

2002.04.10 Matthias Fichtner
thanks again for your great RegEx implementation. I use it
so often, I wouldn't know what to do without it. :)

2002.03.20 Damien Mangin, France
thank's a lot for your amazing work with the TRegExpr library !
I spent hours trying to embed perl into Delphi program (embedded-perl),
before trying your implementation, which works just fine !

2002.02.26 Bruno Zeitoun, France
I found your TRegExpr  very usefull

2002.02.04 Thor Asmund 
Your implementation is just the right way to do it! 
I am very pleased that you have taken the time to make the only, I think, regexp
component for delphi that supports not only matching but also substitution. I
have been using your library in various applicaitons, for instance a GUI
Search/Replace tool (that replaces in files in subdirectories) and a homepage
image grabber!!

2002.01.24 Piero Longhetto, Italy
i've just finished to download
your TRegExp class for delphi and i thing it's very well done.

2002.01.16 Craig Peterson
We are using RegExpr in the new version of our product, Beyond Compare 2.0
and would be very happy to give you a free license as thanks for your great 
component.

2001.12.24 Martin Fuller, UK
I have used your TRegExpr to do some simple parsing of Delphi code.  Thank you!  It is easy to use
and your demo application is very helpful.  All the expressions I needed worked perfectly.

2001.12.11 Tobias Theune, Germany
i was looking for a regular expression for urls and email and found
your routines. its working pretty good

2001.11.15 Jelmer Vos, Netherlands
I just want to say that TRegExpr is great. It is so functional why does 
Borland put TRegExpr default in Delphi?  Is is so cool for a programmer.
I do not send such e-mails, but for this I do, because I just want to say
thanks! :)
And I hope that you are developing TRegExpr in de future so it will even
greater and better.
If someone ask me for a good RegEx component/unit for Delphi I wil alway
give your homepage! :)

2001.10.26 John Hocking
Thanks for the great component you have provided. I have used version 0.938 with
success.

2001.10.18 Gerald Nunn, Canada
I've been looking at your regexp component and it looks very nice.

2001.10.16 Sony Arianto Kurniawan, Indonesia
Thanks for your great regex library for delphi. I'm using it in my 
application and perhaps i always use it in all of my app ;) Many of my app 
is get data from internet and parse it, so i think your regexpr is powerful 
:)))

2001.10.15 Jim McKay, Oakland, Ca.
I just wanted to say thanks.  RegExpr is 
 very nice, great help file, great demo.  I happy as hell!

2001.09.27 Bernie
Thank you for the excellent regular expression object for Delphi and
Builder. I have compiled and the example in Delphi and enjoyed testing it. 

2001.09.24 Rendenbach Marc, Germany
since a few weeks i use your TRegExpr Class for Delphi. Really great
stuff

2000.09.06 Oland, Russia
Спасибо. Очень много интересной информации.

2000.09.03 David Gerrald, USA
Keep Up the good work!

2001.08.29 Armando de la Torre
thank you for creating such a great library.

2001.08.10 Janus N. Tondering, DK
 Your component works great and is easy to use (if
you know regexp). 

2001.08.06 Dave Hughes, UK
thank you so much for releasing a freeware regular expression 
library, especially one so feature packed, fast and reliable as this one (I'd 
written one myself - but it was a bit buggy and used a horribly slow and 
complicated recursive algorithm - yuck!).

2001.06.29 Jeremy Echols
I've downloaded and have been using your TRegExpr object, and it's actually 
working very well. 
thanks for your great regular expressions class.

2001.06.14 Naguschewski Andreas, Germany
TRegExpr - TREMENDOUSLY INGENIOUS!
thx for offering your work for free, man. it's great!

2001.06.09 Miroslav Vracevic
I think that your TRegExpr is pretty cool!

2001.05.16 Aaron Chan
Your TRegExpr is great!

2001.05.04 Riccardo Zanelli, Italy
Great stuff this Tregexpr!
Do you need an Italian translation of the Help file?
I may volounteer...! ;-)

2001.04.09 Anatoly, Russia
Big thank, man!

2001.03.19 Dennis Gurock
Thank you for TRegExpr. It is very very very usefull :) Keep up the good
work.

2001.03.13 Andrew Fedorov, Russia
TRegExpr is very userful component. Thank you.

2001.03.12 Peter Furlan, Germany
Thank you a lot for AudioInfo... it works nice!

2001.03.02 Uncle BNC, Russia
Большое спасибо за TRegExpr!!!
С такой штукой жизнь(работа в смысле) программера становится намного легче!

2001.03.01 Martin Ledoux, Quebec, Canada
Thank's a lot for this very good class, this is a very usefull and
powerfull one. I have big projects with this one.
By using this class I think the least I can do is to translate it in
french.

2001.02.25 shukaiyong, China
   Your TRegExpr is very useful, Thanks.

2001.01.12 Ivan Tugoy, Russia
меня не перестает удивлять
ваш модуль по работе с регулярными выражениями. Спасибо большое за это почти
совершенство, которое спасает уйму времени и в некоторых случаях вообще
незаменимо. Да здравствует perl и object pascal. Меня признаться всегда
удивляло почему borland в свое время сам не сделал такой вот компонент.

2001.01.30 Kit Eason
I'm using TRegExp in a shareware utility I am writing.
Many thanks for this brilliant component!

2001.01.20 Diego Calp, Argentina
Your work is excellent, congratulations! I'm working with Excel 
DDE connection, parsing strings like 
        '[BUDGET.XLS]Main table'!R10C10:R30C12,
piece of cake with your library!! 

2000.12.29 Matthew Winter
I have just started to make use of the Regular Expression package,
and I have to say. Excellent work.

2000.12.28 Kire Mrceski, Yugoslavia
thanks

2000.12.27 Atli Bjцrgvin Oddsson, Iceland
Like your Delphi Regular expression component a lot! 
Easy to use and comes with good examples. This should be 
included with standard Delphi! :)

2000.12.05 Rob McCormack
  Let me say how much I like
  your TRegExpr. Excellent!

2000.11.12 Knud Ole Reffstrup, Denmark
I am writing you to inform you about the use I have made of your
TRegExpr-unit for Delphi.
I am a teacher. The Danish teachers in Computer Science have just 
held their annual meeting, and I held a presentation, where I introduced 
the subject Regular Expressions with examples from Perl, Delphi (using 
your unit) and JavaScript.
I find your unit very versatile and easy to use. The fact that it is
distributed as a unit and not a component to be installed in the
Delphi-system makes it particularly attractive.

2000.09.20 Dod 
veryveryvrey nice job !!! :-) Since I
discovered Perl, I did a lot of things because of regexp but with no
Graphical interface...just batch mode, but now I'll be able to go back
to Delphi with that lovely RegExp library, agin many thanx for having
making it !

2000.09.13 Heikko Webers
I like your component !

2000.08.26 Jon Smith
Finally - I would like to thank you again for a most excellent component!
It is truly a joy to use and solves a very troublesome programming problem
with ease and elegance.

2000.08.12 Edan P.
After searching for a good regular expression parser on the net, I came 
across your component, and was very impressed. It got everything I need, and 
its just a unit that can easily be added to my project.

2000.07.09 Andrew, Europe
TRegExpr was a first toolkit I used to solve some string handling problems 
and I found it powerfull enough for that case.
Generally TRegExpr is stable and very usefull. Thank you.

2000.06.21 Terry Thomas, USA
Das Vadonia!
Sorry, I can't spell in Russian but "Hello" from Atlanta, Georgia in the USA.
I am just learning Delphi 3 and am amazed with what you are able to do in a few 
lines of code!
You have a lot of skill and knowledge and I wish you well.<BR>
Sperseba / Thank You

2000.06.07 Ramanujan M.S.S, India
Thanks for the nice component. 
It will save hours of coding for searching 
things out from the strings. Great  thought.

2000.06.03 Moisey Oysgelt, USA
I'm evaluating you TregExpr.
You did a grate job with this component. Thank you for doing this job.

2000.04.27 Simeon Lilov, Bulgaria
I used TRegExpt to make a DLL and now I use this DLL in Progress 4GL. And it works just fine! I
did'n encounter any problems yet.
I like TRgExpr very much! You have done great work!

2000.04.09 Gerard Cote, Canada
Hello Andrey,
I'm glad to (Virtually) meet you on the net. It's like
a great trip for me to the far from America but nevertheless
dreamed of Russia ans St-Petersbourg.
I found your work very useful to me. I already teached Unix 
and the Grep like utilities and will undoubtedly find some 
utility for your Rgrepexe tools as I am learning Delphi to 
support my back end engine on my new NT Internet Web server,
which will be used for teaching support. so I will have to 
analyse open responses to many exams... and your tool will 
be welcome then.

2000.04.05 Joe Ward
I want to say that this is a great library.  Thanks!

2000.03.28 Basri
Thank you for your Delphi implementation of
RegExpr. An excellent work.

2000.03.22 Yvon Labbee
I took your TAudio library it works fine so Thank you. 

2000.03.21 Zlatka, Russia
Have downloaded your Regular Expression component. :)
It's a perfectly new thing for me :( , but how much easier
my work could be if I had had it earlier!

2000.03.20 Martin Baur, Switzerland
Hi Andrey
Fine homepage ... nice look ... everything that's needed is there.
And of course thank you for your honorable mention of me in your help file ... 
I was not aware that I did earn this .. :-)
Anyway, I was always lurking for some thing like TRegExpr in native Delphi 
code ... you gave it to us and this is what need some honorable metion.

2000.03.08 Stephan Klimek, Munic, Germany
You did a hell of a job for integrating this
little perlish things ;-)

2000.02.24 Vlad, Russia
I try to write this on c many years ago :)
but my small attempt forgotten a long time :)
thanks for sources and examples :)

2000.02.22 chenbm, Fuzhou, China
Thank Your' regular expressions unit!!
